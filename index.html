		<h1>App Review - NIC Athletics</h1>
		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		<p>After the winter semester of 2022 ended, I wanted to do a quick project where I would test the knowledge of
			design I gained in that semester. I wanted to practice making design systems on the biggest scale I could do
			for a small project and apply the best practicing in UI I've learned so far. I like doing real-life
			projects. So it took me a while to figure out what project I would do. Since I love sports, particularly
			soccer, I signed up for soccer at Comox Valley Social Club, and when I saw who was our first team to play
			against, it hit me. We played against the North Island College team. I wondered why NIC doesn’t have its own
			teams. I knew many players that play on different teams. So, the idea started to make a single-page mockup
			for a fictional NIC Athletic team website.
		</p>
		<h2>Discover</h2>
		<p>Before I even started doing any research, I asked myself, “why would NIC need such a website or team.” If I
			ignore all the administrative and logistic obstacles, I can see a big opportunity for NIC to expand and
			stand out from all Vancouver Island Colleges/Universities. Potentially, it can attract many new students
			that love sports. It can make a sports community around sport. It can connect newcomers, new students and
			other people, especially during the post-COVID time. It will make more straightforward access to sports for
			people that the NIC brought here. Great, the biggest question is answered!I knew it wasn’t a revolutionary
			idea to make a college athletic team. There are plenty of colleges that have a long tradition of their
			sports teams. Nevertheless, it wasn’t a disadvantage. So I started digging into schools' athletic teams and
			saw how huge those communities are! These websites contain scoreboards, reports, posts, videos, merchandise,
			fan zones, interviews, etc.

		<h2> Develop</h2>
		I want to practice my HTML/CSS skills. After a quick research, I made a few low-fidelity wireframes and started
		making my mockup with particular components. I included a header, footer, video carousel, post carousel, CTA
		where students could sign up to a team (I know this is not how college athletic teams work), post list, trusted
		companies, scoreboard calendar of events, sign up form and more.
